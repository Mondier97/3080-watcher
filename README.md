# 3080-watcher

A simple node.js application built with typescript to watch www.nowinstock.net and email a user
when an nvidia 3080 graphics card becomes available for purchase. I've been trying to buy one
for a while and this is my likely futile attempt to secure one without resorting to counter
scalping.
